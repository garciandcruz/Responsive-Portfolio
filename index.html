                <p>My name is Garcian D'Cruz! I want to welcome you all to my portfolio page that I created. I am
                    currently enrolled in the Coding BootCamp at UNC-Chapel Hill. This is my first homework assignment
                    and I wanted it to count towards my portfolio.</p>
                <p>I was born in Mumbai, India and moved to the United States when I was 1 year old. I have since lived
                    in Chapel Hill my whole life. I went to Chapel Hill High School and then I attended Elon University
                    and earned my BSBA with a focus in Marketing. I currently work as a Digital Marketing Specialist
                    for a company called GateHouse Media.</p>
                <p>I also am a USPTA Certified Tennis Professional and currently coach tennis at Cary Tennis Park, The
                    Southern Village Club LLC, and I'm the Assistant Head Coach of Chapel Hill High School's Men's and
                    Women's tennis programs. I also am a recording artist working currently under my manager Nick
                    Clemens. </p>
